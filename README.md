**SrS Logics** is a systems-focused data engineering firm that designs, rebuilds, and stabilizes **production-grade data systems** for organizations where correctness, reliability, and operational trust matter.

## 🧠 What SrS Logics Does

Modern businesses fail not because of lack of data — but because their **data systems silently lie**.

SrS Logics exists to eliminate:
- Mismatched reports
- Fragile pipelines
- Manual reconciliations

We work directly at the **system level** — ingestion, validation, modeling, and operational data flows.
